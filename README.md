# finalproject
This project has two goals; the first is to run some preliminary statistical analysis on data collected over two nights for fertilization crosses between 10 distinct colonies of Acropora cervicornis (Staghorn coral), in order to identify any additional predictor variables before testing for an effect of genetic relatedness (data have not been collected for this yet). The second goal of this project is to generate good figures for better visual representation and presentation of the data prior to genetic relatedness analysis. 

The first goal will be completed by testing for a statistically significant differences of rates of fertilization between the nights of the cross performed, and then a test for directionality (sperm or ova first) of the cross performed as a predictor variable for fertilization rate will b e carried out using a linear model. 

The second goal of generating a better visual representation for the data will be done by creating a heatmap in r of each night, showing the crosses and the fertilization rate
